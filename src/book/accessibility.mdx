One of the new subjects of which a Design Technologist is taking care of is
accessibility. The accessibility of websites consists of several entities:
content, user agents (web browsers, media players), assistive technologies,
user's knowledge, software development, authoring tools (tools for creating
websites), and evaluation tools. Accessibility covers the same subjects that
Design Technologists use in their everyday work - design, coding, and user
experience.

Accessibility has become especially important for many companies and public
entities when it was introduced in the legislation of many countries. Thus, it
is not anymore just a question of User Experience, but also law compliance. Web
accessibility requirements are quite technical and thus mainly people with
developer background can understand what do these requirements actually mean and
how they can be implemented. These laws are based on Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, which is more often referred as
[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) are web accessibility guidelines created by the Web Accessibility
Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - international
standards organization for the Internet. WCAG is a set of recommendations for
making the Web more accessible, for people that have temporary or permanent
difficulties with access to websites.

This set of recommendations is created to serve a wide audience of people and
thus following it means also improving the website's overall user experience.
WCAG provides three conformance levels known as Level A, AA, and AAA. According
to the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), a website must satisfy Level A or
otherwise, some users will find it impossible to access it. If a website cannot
satisfy the Level AA then some users will find it difficult to access the
website. Finally, a website may satisfy Level AAA, unless, some users will find
it somewhat difficult to access the website.<ref>1</ref><ref>2</ref><ref>3</ref>

The list of countries that follow WCAG in their laws includes the USA (update
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act), UK (Equality Act), European Union (Web
Accessibility Directive and local country laws based on it), Australia
(Disability Inclusion Act), Israel (Standard 5568), Canada (Jodhan decision).
These laws are usually based on WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 and can include or not private
companies into it.

Accessibility directive in the EU extends WCAG requirements by asking web
service owners to write an accessibility statement that explains which WCAG
requirements are not improved and describing a feedback channel for users to
write about accessibility issues. The user should receive an answer within 14
days and the web service should be ready to provide a user with an alternative
accessible version of the content. The European Accessibility Act is quite broad
and covers many products and services, including ATMs, ticketing, check-in
machines, services related to air, bus, rail, and waterborne passenger
transport, banking services<ref>4</ref><ref>5</ref>

The WCAG guidelines are located on the website of W3C, but for many users, it
might be overwhelming to start with the official documentation. There is a
shorter version "[WCAG checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)"
by WebAIM, which condenses the official WCAG 2.1 specification making it easier
to implement and verify web pages

## Testing and reporting

### Manual testing and screen readers

Manual testing can be done by using a keyboard and trying the website with a
screen reader, checking that page elements like links and buttons indicate their
purpose and state. There are some instructions that can help with the basic
testing:

- [Google Accessibility: How to review](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/how-to-review)
- [Gov.uk Doing basic accessibility test](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one)

Default browser web page components like buttons, inputs, labels, etc. should be
accessible and work quite well with screen readers. That is why it is wise to
use standard HTML tags and components as much as possible. In the case of custom
elements (e.g. button that is done with a div tag), it should be taken into
account WAI ARI practices that are used by browser creators (and other software
that should work with assistive technologies). One of the ways to do it is to
make sure that these new custom components use special HTML ARIA tags, which
screen readers can understand, and mark properly r between relations components.
WAI-ARIA practices also include information about component interaction with
keyboard key presses. The more detailed information by component types can be
found in the WAI-ARIA manual

<p>
  <refLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/" />
</p>

A screen reader is a technology that helps people with difficulties to access
and work with digital content. It includes not only websites but also
applications, audio, and video content, PDF files, and other types of content.
The main users of screen readers are people with limited vision and, in such
case, the screen reader reads out loud what is on the screen. The users can
adapt them to their needs, for example, you can decrease the speed of speech, or
change the language. Screen readers allow also to navigate through websites and
applications via the speech output. When trying to explore whether a webpage is
accessible or not - 2 main questions should be asked: can a user navigate the
page with a keyboard or screen-reader and are all the page elements properly
marked up for screen readers. To answer the second question, it is possible to
use automated testing tools. But to answer first - tools some should use manual
testing with a screen reader. Listening to your web content rather than looking
at it can be an interesting experience and can show drawbacks of web page
component workflow. There are quite many mistakes that would have been hard to
catch visually. Screen readers are very useful for checking the image
alternative text quality. Screen readers can also help to identify problems with
elements' order, table markup, form elements, and many other
aspects.<ref>6</ref><ref>7</ref><ref>8</ref>

**List of screen readers**

- [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/turn-on-and-practice-voiceover-iph3e2e415f/ios) -
  screen reader in MacOS and iPhone /iPad
- [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) - a screen reader for Windows, free and
  open-source
- [TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en) -
  Android
- [ChromVox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox-classic-extensi/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn) -
  Chrome

## Automated testing

Many companies are using automated Chrome Dev Tools Audits (built-in Chrome) as
a measure of success - it shows an easy to understand percentage of passed
accessibility tests. While this tool can be useful, the automated tests cover
just part (around 30%) of the all possible accessibility issues and can not be
used to measure success.

### Browser extensions

**AxE**

The biggest and one of the most popular tools for automated web accessibility
testing, because it is used as a basement for Google Chrome Dev Tools
accessibility testing and e.g. addons for Storybook. It supports WCAG 2.1 and
analyzes part of its issues (some 2.0 issues + 2 of 17 issues for 2.1).

AxE can be used directly in Google Chrome DevTools, as a separate extension for
Google Chrome, as part of Microsoft Accessibility Insights tool, or as the
terminal application for testing.

**Accessibility Insights for Web Accessibility**

Insights for Web is an extension for Chrome and the new Microsoft Edge that
helps developers find and fix accessibility issues in web apps and sites. The
tool supports two primary scenarios: FastPass is a lightweight, two-step process
that helps developers identify common, high-impact accessibility issues in less
than five minutes. The assessment allows anyone with HTML skills to verify that
a web app or web site is compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) 2.1 Level AA

<p>
  <refLink href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview" />
</p>

**IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker**

The IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker is an open-source tool for web
developers and auditors that utilizes IBM's accessibility rule engine, which
detects accessibility issues for web pages and web applications. The extension
integrates into the browser development tools, providing an integrated checking
experience, helping users quickly identify the source of accessibility issues,
and try to fix them.

</p>

**Wave Accessibility tool WAVE**

WAVE is a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content
more accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can identify many
accessibilities and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also
facilitates human evaluation of web content. You can use the online WAVE tool by
entering a web page address (URL) in the field above. WAVE Firefox and Chrome
extensions are available for testing accessibility directly within your web
browser - handy for checking password-protected, locally stored, or highly
dynamic pages.

**Chrome Lens**

The ChromeLens extension allows to simulate an experience of a blind or
colorblind person and contains trackers to visually show the path of a
tab/shift-tab navigation flow with the keyboard.

### Software testing

**Pa11y**

Pa11y is a set of free and open-source tools that aim to help designers and
developers make accessible websites. They offer a range of utilities, including
a dashboard interface, web service, and a desktop application. Behind the
scenes, Pa11y CI uses HTML CodeSniffer in Headless Chrome to evaluate web pages
based on the WCAG 2.1

<p>
  <refLink href="https://pa11y.org/" />
</p>

**Axe**

Axe is used in Chrome Dev Tools for usability testing, but by itself, it can be
quite raw for use in automated testing. There are axe-core, which allows
creating scripts for testing and axe-cli for execution in a terminal.

<p>
  <refLink href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" />
</p>

**jest-axe**

jest-axe is an npm package that wraps axe-core for use in Jest tests. It takes
HTML input and runs axe tests against it alongside other Jest tests, outputting
any failures to the console and failing a build in the same way as a standard
test.

<p>
  <refLink href="https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe" />
</p>

**Paypal AATT**

AATT includes HTML CodeSniffer, Axe, and Chrome developer tool with Express and
PhantomJS, which runs on Node.

<p>
  <refLink href="https://github.com/paypal/AATT" />
</p>

**Eslint for JSX**

A11Y Pairing this plugin with an editor lint plugin, you can bake accessibility
standards into your application in real-time.

<p>
  <refLink href="https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" />
</p>

**Webhint**

webhint is a customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's
accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your
code for best practices and common errors. Can be installed as VS Code plugin as
well and as CLI

<p>

## Accessibility test checklist

Each of the projects should be checked for accessibility separately. Any changes
to design and structure can bring new challenges and accessibility should be
rechecked.

**Accessibility should be checked on 3 levels**

1. Design (contrasts, colors, alignments, language, UI logic)
2. Technical (taking into account assistive technologies)
3. Usability (testing with assistive technology, with real users)

**General principles**

- Hiding all visual elements that are selectable by a screen reader, but do not
  bring any information (textual description) with it
- Following HTML5 semantics, as it can be used by screen readers (headings,
  headers, and footer, navigation, etc.)
- If not possible to change texts that do not bring with them any useful
  information ("Click here"). then add more detailed information in nearby
  interactive elements that can have such description, e.g. checkboxes, radio
  buttons, and fields with a label
- Control focus with Javascript when needed (Modals, Popup menu)
- Let users skip navigation and groups of items (checkboxes, radio buttons)
- Make sure that table tags have description and names of columns

**Examples**

- Headings H1-H6 (preferably one H1 per page)
- Semantic landmark tags (Header, Footer, Navigation, Aside, etc.)
- Labels for checkboxes, radio buttons, and inputs
- Logical connections between elements and their textual descriptions
- Readability of links (avoid just “Read more” or overcome it with ARIA labels
  with additional information)
- Skipping non-informative elements of design (design images, \* asterisks as a
  marker for a required field, etc.
- Describing pictures well with informative text when needed
- Descriptions for infographics Special screen-reader links that suggest you
  skip navigation and go directly to content
- Hiding icons from the accessibility tree, if they do not bring any textual
  information
- Avoid usage of carousels Web components as elements outer DOM elements are not
  connected with Shadow DOM
- Using arrows for moving in groups of checkboxes and radio buttons

## Reporting

The official W3C organization tool that can help to generate a report according
to the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM). It
does not perform any accessibility checks, but has an interactive form with
links to WCAG and can build a structured report
