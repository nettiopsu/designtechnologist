The division between designers and developers is often explained as the
difference between the creative right and the logical left brain hemispheres as
if they almost would not interact with each other. Psychologists have broken the
stereotype of left-right brain halves over the past decade multiple times. <ref>4</ref>
Popular psychology, though, continues using this myth as an argument in
countless articles. In essence, there are self-help books that claim they will
assist you to optimize the functions of one of the hemispheres, or even make the
two halves stop their fighting with each other so you can finally relax. <ref>5</ref> The
truth is they are both well-connected in healthy people; they operate together
and share information across the unique bridge. <ref>6</ref> They do, of course,
specialize in different kinds of tasks; however, the real distinction between
them is much more complicated. <ref>5</ref> In fact, creative and rational decisions
involve both hemispheres - playing music requires repetitive hand movements
(considered to be left-brained) as well as improvising and being emotionally
connected to the music (right-brained). Creativity involves applying imagination
to some initial ideas, re-combining them, and solving problems in a novel but
helpful way. <ref>7</ref> In other words, being a specialist does not prevent you from
specializing in other areas, too, learning and mixing ideas.

Philosopher Isaiah Berlin in the 1950s wrote an article called "The Hedgehog and
the Fox" by adopting the Greek poet Archilochu's famous principle: "the fox
knows many things; the hedgehog one big thing." Berlin divided great thinkers in
his essay into two categories: foxes, who have many different viewpoints, and
hedgehogs, who have one perspective on the world. This essay was, in a way,
sarcastic; still, it became a foundational part of thinking about the
distinction between specialists and generalists: <ref>1</ref> those who often try
unrelated and contradictory outcomes in one way, and those who connect
everything to a single point. A generalist is a competent jack of all trades
with different skills and capabilities, while the specialist's experience and
expertise focus on a concrete area.

The separation into generalist and specialist species is also a known division
in behavioral ecology. Generalist species are thriving in a wide variety of
environmental conditions, and they thrive in a diversity of different resources.
In contrast, specialist species require a particular type of food and specific
items in their habitat. Species broadly vary from highly-specialized to
broadly-generalist species. <ref>3</ref>

In real life, generalists have interdisciplinary knowledge, which boosts
creativity and understanding of how things work. They understand better a
problem and can perform better in second-order thinking in different conditions
than the specialist can. Generalists often maintain interchangeable expertise,
which enables them to choose their career more quickly, do different types of
work, and adapt to a continually changing world dynamics. <ref>1</ref>

On the other hand, specialists are dependent on changes, while many related job
titles are vanishing while technologies are changing, and risk the replacement
by artificial intelligence in the coming years. Many of them have to learn
different working expertise, start in a new field, and thus, this situation puts
their personal growth under threat. <ref>1</ref> Specialists with their deep
understanding of subjects have benefits comparing to generalists - they can
easier recognize and catch rising opportunities. <ref>2</ref>

Usually, the generalists in a team can struggle with the problems because no one
has the expertise to resolve them. Similarly, a specialist is generally
concentrated on a single subject, making them very useful at very particular
topics. Specialists miss the problems which other specialists focus on, and as a
result, can struggle to work with those other specialists efficiently. <ref>13</ref>

There is, nevertheless, a middle-point for specialists and generalists -
generalizing specialist or a specialist in one area that holds a few general
iterative skills. A generalizing specialist has a core competency that they know
a lot about, and they are always learning new aspects of their work and related
fields. A generalist has approximately identical knowledge of multiple subjects
while generalizing specialist has an extensive understanding of one expertise
field and depthless of several other ones, having an opportunity to improve the
main competency while establishing a basis of interdisciplinary awareness. <ref>1</ref>
Generalizing specialists are often also referred to as craftspeople,
multi-disciplinary developers, cross-functional developers, deep generalists,
polymaths, versatilists, or even "renaissance developers". <ref>13</ref>

They also can be found under another name. Tim Brown, CEO of the IDEO design
consultancy, in 1991, mentioned T-shaped people in his interview. T letter's
vertical stroke represents the depth of skill and expertise in a single field
that allows contributing to the creative process (an architect, a business
specialist, an industrial designer, a social scientist, a mechanical engineer,
etc.). In contrast, the horizontal bar is the collaboration across disciplines
with relevant skills and interest in areas of expertise other than own. <ref>8</ref>
T-shaped people are adapting to the market, doing the same duties with fewer
workers, help communicate more effectively, embracing human adaptability. <ref>9</ref>
The details, however, vary from one person to another. If some is starting the
career path, then the skillset can be more of I person or specialist with no
general knowledge, or of "-" dash person (generalist) with diverse expertise but
no specialization. <ref>10</ref> There also by X-shaped peopled, who are leaders and
managers that can support diverse teams, focused on strategy and organization
management, but we will not discuss it furthermore as not relevant here <ref>11</ref>

The job market, in a meanwhile, reacts to changes happening in the world by
creating "hybrid" jobs, or in other words, jobs for T-shaped generalized
specialists and generalists. These new hybrid jobs are advanced and
multi-disciplinary. They mix job titles and skills in a new way - for example,
data scientists, security analysts, product managers, marketing managers, UI
designers and design, user experience, data analysis, interpretation, business
intelligence. <ref>12</ref>

Hybrid job workers have to learn these and other skills through years of working
experience and self-development because only 16% of the high-powered hybrid jobs
are entry-level. They are being paid 20-40% higher than their more-traditional
counterparts and constitute 12% of all job openings and do not truly face the
possibility of replacement by artificial intelligence in the coming years.
Unlike specialists that will need to learn new working skills, and starting over
in a new field will put them back decades. Frequently the analysis, soft skills,
and new technology management lead to the creation of hybrid jobs. <ref>12</ref>

There is a potential problem for education and training institutions that must
teach generalized specialists and generalists, and for mid-career workers who
must know what skills to add to their portfolio — and when. There is a problem,
though, that current curricula and programs de-linking many of these skills from
each other. Besides, the rapid and dynamic change in the job market makes it
hard for higher education to adjust to the market's needs <ref>12</ref>
