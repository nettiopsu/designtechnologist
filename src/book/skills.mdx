There are different names for the role of Design Technologist, but there is a
basic skill set that is well established: the ability to write code, build
prototypes, and at the same type be sensitive to design and user experience. But
the most important skills that clearly stand out are, of course, design and
coding. More than half of IT jobs and more than a quarter of jobs outside of IT
these days require knowledge of digital design; successful workers must think
like designers. On the other hand, coding is also increasing its influence in
various positions and require knowledge of it till some extent for graphic
designers, marketers, and business people. Half of all job openings in the top
income quartile are in positions that now show a significant demand for coding
skills.<ref>1</ref><ref>2</ref>

In day-to-day work, Design Technologist’s main tasks are tasks of Front-End
developer and are related to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The scope is what
differs this skillset from regular Front-End Developer: Design Technologist
should be able to develop rapidly mockups and prototypes showing how sites would
look and work, generate prototypes to help illustrate UX solutions and
interactive designs.<ref>3</ref><ref>4</ref>

The required skillset and knowledge level quite often depend on the company
where the Design Technologist is working. In case of a freelancer, you would
need to know a great deal of design. When working for startups or agencies,
knowing exactly how much effort implementing a certain feature makes it much
easier to prioritize steps during the first design phases. It also allows to
avoid checking the design with the development team all the time. This is
especially useful if you work remotely or in different time zones and cannot
easily communicate with colleagues at any time you need to. If you have at least
basic Front-End skills (HTML/CSS), fixing some code by yourself will take a
minimum amount of time. In bigger organizations knowing some design would help
you communicate your ideas better with other teams and with
designers.<ref>6</ref><ref>14</ref>

## Prototyping

The role of Design Technologist is sometimes called UX prototyper. During the
design phase, a Design Technologist converts design intent to real prototypes. A
prototype is unlikely to have production-ready code, but certainly part of it
can be reusable and thus prototypes and specifications can be used later in the
implementation phase by the engineering team. It also helps the designer find UX
problems earlier and in communicating design intent faster. The series of
prototypes multiplied by Design thinking then come to play by minimizing the
uncertainty and risk of innovation and by engaging with users in learning,
testing, and refining concepts. Design Technologists build exploratory solutions
to solve the problem instead of just making empirical assumptions on how to
solve a UX problem, which then ensures that team members spend less time
planning and more time doing.<ref>6</ref><ref>7</ref>

One of the popular methods to organize fast prototyping with designers is RITE
or Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation. It allows updating design quickly in
response of customer feedback. It differs from usual usability testing because
it advocates for UI changes once a problem is found and a solution is
clear.<ref>8</ref>

It is useful to learn the basics of classical design as well, including type,
space, motion, color, and rhythm, which apply also to the Web. The fundamentals
of design relate to user experience in a stronger way than most realize.
Inspiration often comes outside the web and uses the tools of the web to make
your ideas come alive. A Design Technologist also should be able to answer
different tricky design questions: why text is left-aligned, why paragraphs
should be longer than 50-70 characters per line, why it is better dark-colored
text on light-colored backgrounds etc.<ref>9</ref><ref>10</ref>

Vector and static design tools will be always a part of your arsenal, because it
reflects what users see, when they use your product. Getting outside the
comfortable boundaries of static design tools allows though to explore more
exciting and innovative solutions and to open your eyes to new ways of
interacting with products.<ref>10</ref>

## Front-End development

In many teams Design Technologists handle the Front-End implementation role. In
such case they might support designers so that they do not have to be any more
detailed in their instructions - due to the Design Technologist’s eye for
design. In the engineering side, the core Design Technologist skill is
problem-solving. There is always a need to take a problem and break it down to
its subcomponents and then tackle individual problems. Concretely in Front-End
side, the Design Technologist might be focused on interactive features,
including, for example, animations, touch, tap, and swipe gestures,
accessibility features etc. Often, however, a Design Technologist is not
directly intersecting with other Front-End developers, as they have quite
concrete design tasks assigned to them like designing graphic user interface
elements (menus, tabs, widgets), building page navigation buttons and search
fields, designing responsive interfaces etc.<ref>7</ref>

Another task that Design Technologists can do is finding inefficient processes,
creating new processes or tools to improve old ones. For example, some can write
a plugin to auto populate data into Sketch mocks, a tool to help researchers
interpret video recordings of usability studies, a mockup viewer that shows
designs in different devices and sizes or dashboards to track new
metrics.<ref>11</ref><ref>12</ref>

**Skills**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ECMAScript 6)
- JavaScript frameworks (React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js)
- Build tools (webpack, gulp)
- CSS pre-processors, post-processors (SASS, LESS, PostCSS)
- Animations
- Accessibility (automated testing)
- Algorithms
- Software design patterns
- Responsive design
- Testing and debugging (Jest, Enzyme, Axe)
- Version control (git, GitHub, GitLab)
- Package and dependency managers (npm, yarn)
- Command line tools
- Progressive Web Apps
- Browser dev tools
- Design systems
- Engineering tools (Visual Studio Code, Atom,
  WebStorm)<ref>9</ref><ref>13</ref>

## UX

Getting a Design Technologist on the team means there is always an engineer
whose work is first and most important, the user experience. It means minor
things like CSS animations, button alignment, and error messages, and major
things like consistency, brand, and usability will not be forgotten. It also
means that to turn into a Design Technologist you would also need to have at
least some experience in the core UX principles, philosophies, and methods. This
includes, but is not limited to, how and why to do user research, wireframing
and personas.<ref>7</ref><ref>11</ref>

**Skills**

- Usability
- UX testing
- Personas
- UX writing
- Service blueprints
- Customer journey map
- UX research

## Soft skills

These skills will ensure that you land your dream job, whatever the
requirements. Not only does it highlight the multidisciplinary nature of design
technologists, it also shows that mostly they form medium between other fields,
often with conflicting goals.<ref>9</ref>

**Skills**

- Communication (written and verbal)
- List item
- Teamwork
- Empathy for users
- Problem solving
- Critical thinking
- Business skills
