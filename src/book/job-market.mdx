There is a fundamental shift going on nowadays - businesses that do not
prioritize UX are go out of business and other more agile companies take their
places instead. Customers prioritize nowadays services from the companies, which
do not focus on their own needs instead of the needs of their clients. They are
hiring significantly more designers than ever before and boosting their designer
to developer hiring target ratio. For example, Atlassian has gone from the
proportion of 1 designer and 25 engineers to 1 designer and 9 developers. Uber's
design team has grown 70 times since 2012, and they are now targeting 1 designer
to 8 engineers.<ref>1</ref><ref>2</ref>

Is not a surprise that the hybrid role of Design Technologist is appearing in
the job market. The high salary jobs of the foreseeable future are more
complicated and multi-disciplinary. Specialist roles become more complex and
they need a broad set of skills from various disciplines (design, user
experience, data analysis and interpretation, business insights), and as a
result, are rapidly growing in value. The hybrid jobs are rapidly growing in
value – demand and salary, but they also are immune to automation.<ref>3</ref>

There is no universal definition for the Design Technologist role and thus
companies and individuals tend to project their own experience and prerequisites
into definitions that suit them. For example, many occurrences of the job title
Design Technologist can be found in the design agencies which are moving forward
from their earlier experience in advertising, and therefore the use of creative
technologies still highlights the importance of understanding brands and
business. And therefore experience of a Design Technologist can vary from a
company that is creating a single product or a webshop to a larger corporation
in which the only client is itself.<ref>4</ref><ref>5</ref>

The Design Technologist role did not exist a decade ago, but now it becomes more
common and can be found under different names. Examples in big companies like
Facebook, Google, Amazon include for example UX Engineer, UX Developer, Creative
Developer, Creative Technologist, UX Prototyper and Growth Engineer. There are
also more rare variations that can be found in job boards: Product design
engineer, Technical Program Manager or even an Engineer in a Product Design or
Experience Design team. It is worth mentioning that big companies (Amazon, eBay,
etc.) tend to call the position Design Technologist, and the work usually
includes heavy prototyping skills. An exception is Google, which has a UX
engineer position, which is usually called Creative Technologist in other
companies and which includes knowledge of animations, WebGL, 3D and VR/AR.
Smaller companies are looking usually for UX engineers and UX developers on the
other hand. On the other hand, Growth Engineer is something special, but still
similar in many senses to Design Technologist. The difference is that Growth
Engineer is not working in a design or UX team, but in a marketing team and
therefore depends heavily on A/B testing and analytics tools

Finding a job in this field can be difficult, particularly in the very beginning
of a career. It might be hard to find an industry which matches your interests
and enables you to make a living at the same time. The number of vacancies is
still relatively low and quite often positions appear only in big companies.
There is nothing to worry about though because everything is changing for the
better and a few years ago finding a job under the Design Technologist title
would be even more complicated.<ref>5</ref>

### Design Technologist at Netflix

Do you feel equally at home dreaming up new ideas to create elegant and
delightful user experiences as you do rolling up your sleeves and writing the
code that brings these ideas to life? Do you have the mindset of a Product
Designer but the skills of a Senior Front-end Engineer? If so, we’d love to
chat. The Design Technology team is looking for a new addition to the team who
can help us continue to make progress on Netflix’s mission to entertain the
world.

**About the Interactive Experiences Design Team**:

This Design Technologist role is slated to support and partner with our
Emmy-award-winning Interactive Experiences Design team. If helping the team
whose charter is to imagine and design what the future of interactive
storytelling on Netflix looks like, then this might be the role for you.

**About the role**:

Our discipline goes by many names, including Design Technologist, UX Engineer,
Creative Technologist, Design Engineer and UX Prototyper. This unique
combination of Design perspective + Engineering skills allows people in this
role to make impactful contributions at each phase of the product lifecycle.

In practice, this means you will help brainstorm and then write the code that
breathes life into new design concepts, making them tangible for the team. This
helps us validate ideas both internally and with our users via in field
qualitative research. You can act as a bridge between the Design team and our
cross-functional partners helping to ensure both design fidelity as well as
technical feasibility.

In addition to working on projects that aim to improve the user experience in
our product, our team also looks for opportunities to leverage technology to
super-charge the design process through building internal tools to yield a more
efficient workflow.

**About you**:

You have a creative mind and a deep understanding of interaction design. You
care about the design details and are driven to push the user experiences you
create beyond acceptable to make them exceptional. You have an entrepreneurial
spirit and bring your own creative ideas into the conversation (instead of
waiting for others to tell you what to make).

Your engineering skills are rock-solid, but you’re never done learning. You have
a curiosity that compels you to try new technologies, build for new platforms
and solve new technical problems. You don’t suffer from ‘analysis paralysis’ and
prioritize trying a bunch of ideas quickly over meditating to find the perfect
architecture.

You thrive on collaboration. You’re inclusive in your engagement with your team
and cross-functional partners. You’re mature enough to not have an ego, and you
welcome honest, open feedback as easily as you give it. You demonstrate
selflessness by prioritizing making the right call for the business, team or
project over your own personal opinion.

**You bring**:

- A great portfolio showing several years worth of complex, highly usable
  interactive UIs.
- Several years of senior-level experience writing HTML, JavaScript and CSS
  applications and fluency with modern frameworks and libraries such as React
  and NodeJS
- Experience creating performant animations on the web using both CSS and
  JavaScript • Proven leadership and strategic ability to drive initiatives and
  projects with teams
- The communication skills to clearly articulate your concepts—and evangelize on
  their behalf
- Professional experience working in the interactive media and/or gaming
  industry is a strong plus.
- A love of movies, TV shows and interactive media is a plus<ref>10</ref>
